# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marcos MartÃ­nez
  
ðŸ‘¤ I am studying a **Computer Engineering Degree (Sotware Engineering mention)** **Computer Engineering Degree (Sotware Engineering mention)** at **Polytechnic University of Catalonia (FIB-UPC)**. I only have learnt programming at University, so now I'm starting to learn new languages by myself. Here you will find important projects I have done at university and personal projects or practices that I'm doing to learn an specific language.

ðŸ“‹ Programming languages that I know:
- **C and C++**: I have learnt them at University. They are the main language we use, so I have a stronger knowledge than in other languages.
- **Java**: We are doing a entire project in this language at University. That's the reason why I'm new into the language but I have a good knowledge of the basic things (I will upload the project in a repository when we finish the subject).
- **HTML, Javascript and CSS**: I have learnt a little by myself. It's a very basic level as I only have done some projects following a guide.
- **React**: I have done only one project in this language. My knowledge of it is very very basic.

ðŸ‘€ Currently I'm learning by myself a little of many things and languages to see what are my favourite things, but in the future I would like to specialize in something more specific.
