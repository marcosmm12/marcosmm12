- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcosmm12.I am studying a Computer Engineering Degree (Sotware Engineering mention) at Polythecnic University of Catalonia. I only have learnt programming at University, so now I'm starting to learn new languages by myself. Here you will find important projects I have done at university and personal projects or practices that I'm doing to learn an specific language. Currently I'm starting to learn some HTML, Javascript and CSS, and I already know C and C++, but in the future I would like to try new languages and discover what's my favourite to specialize in. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and software engineering. At University we most have used C and C++, but I also would like to learn other languages for different applications like Web pages or mobile apps.
